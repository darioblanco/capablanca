# Capablanca

[Jose Ra√∫l Capablanca y Graupera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ra%C3%BAl_Capablanca) was one of the greatest chess players in history, and gives name to this little chess experiment. Capablanca was awesome, and as any amazing chess guru, he could think in many different chess plays in advance, in order to bow down his rivals.

This little program tries to emulate him, showing all combinations for a given set of pieces in a scenario where none of them can take any of the others.

- Number of each piece to be placed has to be provided
- Pieces don't have colours

A set of chess pieces on a chess board with specific dimensions, where none of the pieces can't take any of the others
